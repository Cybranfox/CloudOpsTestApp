# AWS Orbit RPG Edition – Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a five‑day roadmap to transform the AWS Orbit platform into an RPG‑style learning experience, incorporating new animations, adaptive progression and minigame prototypes. The plan assumes an agile iteration cycle with daily deliverables and testing.

## Day 1: Animation System Refactor
- Upgrade the mascot animation engine to support six states: correct, wrong, idle, sleepy, level‑up, and boss encounter.
- Implement animation blending for smooth state transitions.
- Integrate sound effects for each state.
- Deliverable: `ZapCanvasAnimator` module with placeholder draw functions and state management.

## Day 2: RPG Progression Backend
- Design the skill tree structure (see `skill_tree.py`) with dependencies between AWS domains.
- Implement health and mana mechanics tied to quiz performance and time.
- Expose API endpoints for retrieving skill tree status and updating player stats.
- Deliverable: Flask endpoints `/api/skill_tree` and supporting data structures.

## Day 3: Minigame Prototypes
- Build three minigames: Configuration Rush, Security Dungeon (prototype included), and Cost Optimization Quest.
- Use Canvas or simple HTML forms for prototypes; ensure touch friendliness.
- Deliverable: Sample React component (`SecurityDungeon.jsx`) demonstrating how a minigame interacts with the backend.

## Day 4: Adaptive Content Integration
- Implement a dynamic content engine (`adaptive_learning/engine.py`) that selects the next lesson based on user performance.
- Integrate AWS forums and What’s New content as optional sources.
- Deliverable: API endpoint `/api/next_content` returning remedial or advanced content suggestions.

## Day 5: Mobile Optimization
- Wrap the frontend in a Progressive Web App with service worker and manifest.
- Use IndexedDB for offline storage of lessons and stats.
- Refactor UI components to ensure responsive design on 320 px to 1920 px screens.
- Deliverable: Mobile‑first React components in `mobile_components/` and instructions for deployment.

## Sample Deliverables
- **Zap Animation State Machine Diagram:** A diagram illustrating transitions between idle, correct, wrong, sleepy, level‑up and boss states.
- **RPG Progression JSON:** See `skill_tree.py` for the current data structure; extend it with additional abilities and prerequisites as needed.
- **Mobile‑First Minigame Component:** `SecurityDungeon.jsx` demonstrates a simple touch‑friendly interface that posts a JSON policy to the backend and displays feedback.
- **Content Versioning System:** Track `last_updated` timestamps on each piece of content and maintain a changelog; use semantic versioning for major updates.
